# Neural Insights: Forecasting Academic Achievement through Artificial Intelligence

## Introduction

Welcome to the Neural Insights project! This project aims to predict students' academic performance using artificial neural networks. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to provide educational institutions with a reliable, data-driven tool to enhance their admission decisions.

## Project Scope

### Included
- Predicting academic performance based on historical data and student attributes.
- Utilizing artificial neural networks to achieve high prediction accuracy.
- Providing insights to educational institutions for better decision-making during admissions.

### Excluded
- Real-time data processing.
- Integration with external educational databases.

### Limitations
- The accuracy of predictions depends on the quality and completeness of the input data.
- The model may require retraining as new data becomes available.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- The system should predict academic performance based on input student data.
- The system should handle missing or incomplete data gracefully.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- The system should be scalable to handle a large number of student records.
- The system should provide predictions within a reasonable time frame.

### User Stories
- As an admissions officer, I want to predict student performance to make informed admission decisions.
- As a data scientist, I want to analyze the factors influencing student performance to improve the prediction model.

## Technical Stack

### Programming Languages
- Python

### Frameworks/Libraries
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy

### Databases
- CSV files for data storage and retrieval

### Tools/Platforms
- Jupyter Notebook
- Google Colab

## Architecture/Design

### System Architecture
The system consists of the following high-level components:
- Data Preprocessing: Handles cleaning, encoding, and scaling of input data.
- Neural Network Model: A sequential model built using TensorFlow and Keras.
- Evaluation: Evaluates the model performance using metrics such as RMSE.

### Design Decisions
- **ReLU Activation Function**: Used in hidden layers to introduce non-linearity and ensure efficient training.
- **Linear Activation Function**: Used in the output layer for regression tasks to predict continuous values.
- **Early Stopping**: Implemented to prevent overfitting and ensure optimal model performance.
